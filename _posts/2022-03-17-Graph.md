Summary of graph theory notes from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mathematics-graph-theory-basics-set-1) and relevant Wikipedia entries.

A graph is a data structure consisting of **nodes** (or **vertices**) and **edges** between the nodes, $G = (V, E)$.  Each edge in the graph is identified with the pair of nodes it connects, $(V_i, V_j)$.

### 1. Types of graphs
There are, of course, different types of graphs. Most simply speaking, graphs can be divided into **directed** and **undirected** graphs depending on whether the edges's directions are defined or not. Sometimes, it may also be useful to know if a graph is **acyclic**, meaning that the graph does not contain any group of circularly connected nodes. 
Alternatively, graphs can also be divided into **simple** graphs and **multigraphs**. The former type does not involve more than one edge between any pair of nodes, in contrast to the latter. A simple graph is also **complete** if every pair of nodes is connected by exactly one edge.

### 2. Basic concepts
As one may begin to notice, and not surprisingly, many jargons are used in graph theory. Let's just cover some basic concepts in this section:
- **adjacent** nodes are connected by an edge
- **degree** of a node is the number of nodes connected to the node
	- an **isolated** node has a degree of 0
	- a **pedant** node has a degree of 1
- a **path** is a sequence of connected nodes linking node $i$ to node $j$, $P(i, j) = (v_0, v_1, ..., v_n)$
- **parallel** edges connect the same pair of nodes in a multigraph
- a **loop** is an edge that connects a node to itself

### 3. Handshaking lemma
For an undirected graph, the **degree sum formula** states that $\sum_{v \in V} \mathop{deg} v = 2|E|$, i.e., the sum of degrees of all nodes is equal to twice the number of edges. This is simply because each edge is counted for the degree of nodes at both ends. This leads to the handshaking lemma (or theorem), which states that:
> In every finite undirected graph, the number of vertices that touch an odd number of edges is even ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking_lemma))

The intuition can be understood purely mathematically. Since the sum of degree is even in an undirected graph, the sum of degree from vertices with odd degrees must be even. This is only possible if the number of vertices with odd degrees is even.

### 4. Centrality
There are many different centrality measures in graph theory and network analysis. The main idea is to characterise how important (or *central*) each node is. The definition of importance is, of course, dependent on the application where the graph need to be employed. Here, I will briefly discuss three common centrality measures.
Usually, the centrality values are used to identify a few important nodes or to rank nodes by their importance. However, a limitation of centrality-based ranking is that the centrality measures that are helpful in identifying important nodes may be meaningless for the other not-so-important nodes.

#### 4.1. Degree centrality
The degree centrality is simply the degree of the node, $C_D(v) = \mathop{deg}(v)$. A node with a higher degree is may be an information hub of the network, making it potentially more important.

#### 4.2. Betweenness centrality
The betweenness centrality is the number of times (or frequency of) a node (or an edge) being part of a shortest path.
