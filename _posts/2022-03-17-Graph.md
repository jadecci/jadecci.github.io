Summary of graph theory notes from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mathematics-graph-theory-basics-set-1).

A graph is a data structure consisting of **nodes** (or **vertices**) and **edges** between the nodes, $G = (V, E)$.  

### Types of graphs
There are, of course, different types of graphs. Most simply speaking, graphs can be divided into **directed** and **undirected** graphs depending on whether the edges's directions are defined or not. Sometimes, it may also be useful to know if a graph is **acyclic**, meaning that the graph does not contain any group of circularly connected nodes. 
Alternatively, graphs can also be divided into **simple** graphs and **multigraph**s. The former type does not involve more than one edge between any pair of nodes, in contrast to the latter.

### Basic concepts
As one may begin to notice, and not surprisingly, many jargons are used in graph theory. Let's cover some basic concepts:
- **adjacent** nodes are connected by an edge
- **degree** of a node: number of nodes connected to the node
	- an **isolated** node has a degree of 0
	- a **pedant** node has a degree of 1
- **path**: a sequence of connected nodes linking node $a$ to node $b$, $P(a, b) = (v_0, v_1, ..., v_n)$

### Handshaking lemma
For an undirected graph, the **degree sum formula** states that $\sum_{v \in V} \mathop{deg} v = 2||E||$, i.e., the sum of degrees of all nodes is equal to twice the number of edges. This is simply because each edge is counted for the degree of nodes at both ends. This leads to the handshaking lemma (or theorem), which states that:
> In every finite undirected graph, the number of vertices that touch an odd number of edges is even ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking_lemma))

The intuition can be understood purely mathematically. Since the sum of degree is even in an undirected graph, the sum of degree from vertices with odd degrees must be even. This is only possible if the number of vertices with odd degrees is even.
