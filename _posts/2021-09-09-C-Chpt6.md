This set of notes is based on Chapter 6 in Numerical Recipes in C. 


Codes for implementing algorithms mentioned in this chapter are available at [my Github repository](https://github.com/jadecci/numerical_recipes_c). Each script runs the respective algorithm with example data.

## 1. Gamma, Beta, Factorials, Binomial

The gamma function is defined in relation to the factorial function for integer $z$s (see part 1 in [my notes on distributions](https://jadecci.github.io/notes/Distribution.html) for a simple proof)

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int^{\infty}_0 x^{z-1}e^{-x} \mathop{dx} = (z-1)!
$$

In order to estimate the gamma function outputs, the Lanczos approximation is used, which accounts for all $\mathbb{Re} (z)>0$

$$
\Gamma(z+1) = (z+\gamma+\frac{1}{2})^{z+\frac{1}{2}} e^{-(z+\gamma+\frac{1}{2})} \sqrt{2\pi} (c_0 + \frac{c_1}{z+1} + \frac{c_2}{z+2} + ... +  + \frac{c_3}{z+3} + \epsilon)
$$

As the value of $\Gamma(z)$ can often become overflowingly large, but only required in intermediate steps, it is better to solve for $\ln \Gamma(z)$ instead in practice. Relatedly, the factorial functions can also be estimated as $exp(\ln \Gamma(z+1))$. 

Again, if we can compute $\ln (z!)$, we can continue to estimate the binomial coefficients, which is defined as

$$
{n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \quad 0 \le k \le n
$$

Finally, computing $\ln \Gamma(z)$ also lets us compute the beta function, which is defined as

$$
B(z, w) = \int^1_0 t^{z-1} (1-t)^{w-1} \mathop{dt} = \frac{\Gamma(z) \Gamma(w)}{\Gamma(z+w)}
$$
