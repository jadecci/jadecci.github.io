This set of notes include commands for Unix, Bash, Matlab, Python, etc. that I found useful or easily forgotten.

# Linux

## Linux in general

- Give read & execute rights to all users for a folder and its subfolders

```bash
chmod -R 755 $folder_name
```

- Find file in current folder and subfolders

```bash
find . -name "$file_name"
```

- Print lines (i.e. rows) `x` to `y` in a text file

```bash
head -y $file_name | tail -n $((y-x+1))
```

- Extract columns `x` and `y` from a csv file

```bash
cat $file_name.csv | cut -d ',' -f x,y
```

- Rename part of file name(s)

```bash
rename "s/${old_part}/${new_part}/" $file_name
```

- List size of folders/files in ascending order

```bash
du -sh * | sort -h
```

- Make sure the correct shell (e.g. bash) is used for make installation

```bash
make SHELL=/bin/bash install
```


## MacOS Terminal (uname = Darwin)

- After any major/semi-major update, the command line tool should be updated with 

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

- Fix broken links in dylib

```bash
otool -L $dylib_file
sudo install_name_tool $dylib_file -change $old_link $new_link
```

- Insert the plus/minus sign Â±: `shift` + `alt (options)` + `=`


## Git related

- Create a new branch based on the `develop` branch

```bash
git checkout -b $branch_name develop
```

- Fetch a remote branch (which does not exist locally)

```bash
git switch $branch_name
```

- Delete last commit, keeping the work done

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

- Delete a commit, discarding work done (i.e. reverting the changes)

```bash
git reset --hard $commit_number
```

- Unstage all staged files

```bash
git reset
```

- Revert all local uncommitted changes

```bash
git checkout -- .
```

- Delete  a branch from both local and remote repositories

```bash
git branch -d $branch_name
git push origin --delete $branch_name
```

- Update a forked repository with feature branch `$branch_name`(assuming no conflict)

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
git push origin -f develop
git checkout $branch_name
git rebase develop
```

- Changed a cloned copy to a forked copy & make current branch track a forked branch (e.g. `master` branch)

```bash
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin $fork_address
git branch -u origin/master
```

- Check changes in a file before committing

```bash
(unstaged) git diff $file_name
(staged) git diff --cached $file_named
```

- Check directory sizes based on annex files

```bash
git annex info --fast data/* --json | jq -j '."local annex size", "\t", .directory, "\t", "\n"'
```

## Bash

- Extract part of a string (e.g. getting 0843 from Sub0843_Ses1)

```bash
string=Sub0843_Ses1
string_cut_end=${string%_Ses1}
string_cut_front=${string_cut_end#Sub}
```

- Read values from a csv column into an array

```bash
arr=($(cat $file_name.csv | cut -d ',' -f $column))
```
- Remove Windows/DOS CRLF [line endings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline#Representations) from an array element

```bash
arr1=${arr[1]%$'\r'}
```

- Remove all leading spaces from `zsh` console output

```bash
string="    Sub0843_Ses1"
string_cut=${string##*[[:blank:]]}
```

- Floating point operations (e.g. `x+y/365`)

```bash
echo x y 365 | awk '{printf "%4.3f", $1+$2/$3}'
```

- Suppress 1) warnings and errors 2) all outputs from a command

```bash
1) $command 2> /dev/null
2) $command 1> /dev/null 2>&1
```

- The above might not work inside a script, in which case the `exec` command can be used before the commands generating warnings/outputs.

```bash
1) exec 2> /dev/null
2) exec 1> /dev/null 2>&1
```


## SSH related

- Save host and user name in `~/.ssh/config`

```bash
Host $new_host_name
	Hostname $host_address
	User $user_name
```

- Automatic login: paste content of local `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to remote `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

- File transfer between local machine and SSH server 

```bash
(local to server) rsync -avh --progress $file_path user@host:$destination
(server to local) rsync -avh --progress user@host:$file_path $destination
```

# Python

- Since Python 3.4, it's preferable to use `pip` with

```python
python3 -m pip list
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip --user
python3 -m pip install numpy
```

- Find out which python (e.g. in Jupyter-lab)

```python
import sys
sys.executable
```

- Install a package of a specific version

```python
(new installation) python3 -m pip install -Iv package_name==version
(existing installation) python3 -m pip install -I package_name==version
```

- Print elapsed time in hour-minute-second format

```python
import time
time.strftime("%H:%M:%S", time.gmtime(elapsed_time))
```

- Create function handle (i.e. equivalent to `myfunc = @(x) func(10, x)` in Matlab)

```python
myfunc = lambda x: func(10, x)
```

- Call function with dynamic name

```python
(from another module) output = getattr(module_name, 'func_name')(parameters)
(from the same module) output = globals()['func_name'](parameters)
```

- Reload a module (to reflect changes made to the module)

```python
from importlib import reload
reload(module_name)
```

- Write `stdout` to a log file at real time (from command line)

```bash
python -u $file_name.py > $log_name.txt
```

# Matlab

- Write `long` values to a csv file (e.g. with a precision of `6`)

```matlab
dlmwrite('file_name.csv', variable_name, 'precision', 6);
```

# Vi(m)

- turn off search (#) highlighting

```
:noh
```

# Jekyll

- Install bundles according to specification in `Gemfile`

```
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
```

- Build a site with Jekyll locally

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
(in the browser) http://localhost:4000
```
